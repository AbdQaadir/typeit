## Overview
TypeIt is the most versatile JavaScript typewriter effect utility on the planet. With simple yet flexible configuration, it allows you to type single or multiple strings that break lines, delete & replace each other, and it even handles strings that contain HTML.

For more advanced, controlled typing effects, TypeIt comes with companion functions that can be chained to control your typing down to a single character, enabling you to type an dynamic narrative, with complete reign over speed changes, line breaks, deletions, and pauses.

### Key Features
* Choose to start typing only when your target element becomes visible on the screen.
* Loop your string(s) continuously.
* Define you strings via an options object or in the HTML (useful in case user doesn't have JavaScript enabled, as well as for SEO).
* Use a single TypeIt instance to target several different elements on a page.
* Handle HTML tags (preserving attributes) with ease.
* Use companion functions to chain individual commands together to fine tune your typing.
* Ready to be included via JS module, or as a separate script loaded on your page.
* No dependencies!
